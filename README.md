# Hammer_Net_Calculation_Gravimetry.py

This QGIS Python script calculates the elevation differences between the gravimetric stations and the surrounding terrain, usind data from a Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
It follows Hammer's method (1936, https://doi.org/10.1190/1.144049) by generating concentric rings around each station and dividing each ring into radial compartments to compute elevation averages.

Adjust the parameters inner_radius, outer_radius, and num_compartments to perform calculations for different rings in Hammer's net.

## Inputs

1. **Active Layer of Points**  
   - A layer of points should be active in QGIS, where each point represents a gravimetric station.
   - **Note**: Ensure this layer is active in QGIS before running the script and it is UTM projected

2. **DEM Layers Group ("DEMs")**  
   - DEM layers must be organized in a group called `"DEMs"` within the QGIS Layers Panel.
   - Each DEM layer should cover the region around the points to be processed.
   - **Note**: Ensure this layer UTM projected

3. **Parameters**  
   - `inner_radius` (float): Inner radius of the rings in meters.
   - `outer_radius` (float): Outer radius of the rings in meters.
   - `num_compartments` (int): Number of compartments per ring.

## Outputs

1. **Updated Points Layer**  
   - Adds new fields to the points layer, with each field representing the average elevation difference (divided by 2) for each ring compartment.

2. **Rings Layer**  
   - Creates a new polygon layer representing the concentric rings with compartments around each point.
   - Each compartment includes the following attributes:
     - **Name**: The point's name.
     - **Partition**: The compartment number within the ring.
     - **d_Height/2**: Average elevation difference (divided by 2).
     - **n_pixels**: Number of DEM pixels used in each compartment for the calculations.

## Usage Notes

- Ensure all layers, including the points and DEMs, use the same coordinate reference system (CRS) and they are in UTM.
- This script should be run within the QGIS Python console or as part of a QGIS plugin.

# plot_pdf_hammer_net.py

This Python script reads the CSV table generated by the `Hammer_Net_Calculation_Gravimetry.py` script, which calculates values for three internal rings (spanning 2 to 17, 17 to 53, and 53 to 170 meters). The innermost ring is divided into 4 quadrants, while the middle and outer rings have 6 partitions each. This program then generates a `Hammer_net` chart for each gravimetric station, displaying the halved absolute height differences between each quadrant and the central gravimetric station.

## Features

- **Data Input**: Reads data from an csv file. Each station's data includes:
  - **Name** 
  - **Inner ring** values: 4 partitions.
  - **Middle and outer ring** values: 6 partitions each.
- **Multi-Page Layout**: Arranges up to 6 charts per page (2x3 grid) to fit an A4 page layout.
- **Radial Chart Structure**: Each station chart includes:
  - An inner ring (4 partitions).
  - A middle ring (6 partitions) extending beyond the inner ring.
  - An outer ring (6 partitions) extending beyond the middle ring.
- **Partition Lines**: Partition lines in the middle and outer rings are carefully drawn to avoid overlap with the inner ring.

## Usage

1. **File Requirements**: Place an csv file in the same directory. It should include:
   - Station names and three sets of values, where:
     - Columns B-E represent inner ring values.
     - Columns F-K represent middle ring values.
     - Columns L-Q represent outer ring values.

2. **Adjusting Layout and Partitions**:
   - To modify the number of partitions or layout, adjust the variables in the script:
     - `stations_per_page`, `cols_per_page`, `rows_per_page` for page layout.
     - `plot_circle_with_partitions` function to adjust partition numbers.

## Code Overview

- **Data Input**: Loads data from the csv file.
- **Chart Structure**:
  - The `plot_circle_with_partitions` function handles drawing partitions and positioning values in each ring.
  - Each chart shows the station name, three concentric rings, and values in each partition.
- **Output**: Saves all charts in a single PDF.
